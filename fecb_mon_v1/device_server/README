##### A simple TCP/IP server which communicates with FECB-DeviceClient...

Once Server is run on terminal, It ask for Operation to perform.

 $./server

Enter the Operation Code : 0 for Null, 1 for SETRFSYS, 3 for Domon

NULL and DOMON don't take any arguments.

SETRFSYS ask for Channel 1 & 2 Frequency band ( for ex : 235/325/610/1420)
=> Once we provide both channel frequency band, program packs that with other parameters and send it over to deviceClient.
=> It waits for Intermediate Response and then Final Response, Which will complete the loop.
